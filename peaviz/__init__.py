"""
PEAviz bridges DEAP_ with graph analysis tools like `graph-tool
<http://graph-tool.skewed.de/>`_, gremlin_ or Gephi_. DEAP_ is an amazing
platform for implementing and experimenting Evolutionary Algorithms in the
python programming language.

The aim of PEAviz is to help track the evolutionary dynamics of such algorithms
by encoding desired information in a graph (network) structure. It goes
somewhat beyond DEAP's inbuilt ``History`` object `(ref)
<http://deap.gel.ulaval.ca/doc/dev/api/tools.html#history>`_.
