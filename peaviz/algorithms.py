    :returns: A list of varied individuals that are independent of their
              parents.

    The variation goes as follow. First, the parental population
    :math:`P_\mathrm{p}` is duplicated using the :meth:`toolbox.clone` method
    and the result is put into the offspring population :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`.
    A first loop over :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is executed to mate pairs of consecutive
    individuals. According to the crossover probability *cxpb*, the
    individuals :math:`\mathbf{x}_i` and :math:`\mathbf{x}_{i+1}` are mated
    using the :meth:`toolbox.mate` method. The resulting children
    :math:`\mathbf{y}_i` and :math:`\mathbf{y}_{i+1}` replace their respective
    parents in :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`. A second loop over the resulting
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is executed to mutate every individual with a
    probability *mutpb*. When an individual is mutated it replaces its not
    mutated version in :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`. The resulting
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is returned.

    This variation is named *And* beceause of its propention to apply both
    crossover and mutation on the individuals. Note that both operators are
    not applied systematicaly, the resulting individuals can be generated from
    crossover only, mutation only, crossover and mutation, and reproduction
    according to the given probabilities. Both probabilities should be in
    :math:`[0, 1]`.

    The variation goes as follow. On each of the *lambda_* iteration, it
    selects one of the three operations; crossover, mutation or reproduction.
    In the case of a crossover, two individuals are selected at random from
    the parental population :math:`P_\mathrm{p}`, those individuals are cloned
    using the :meth:`toolbox.clone` method and then mated using the
    :meth:`toolbox.mate` method. Only the first child is appended to the
    offspring population :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`, the second child is discarded.
    In the case of a mutation, one individual is selected at random from
    :math:`P_\mathrm{p}`, it is cloned and then mutated using using the
    :meth:`toolbox.mutate` method. The resulting mutant is appended to
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`. In the case of a reproduction, one individual is
    selected at random from :math:`P_\mathrm{p}`, cloned and appended to
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`.

    This variation is named *Or* beceause an offspring will never result from
    both operations crossover and mutation. The sum of both probabilities
    shall be in :math:`[0, 1]`, the reproduction probability is
    1 - *cxpb* - *mutpb*.
